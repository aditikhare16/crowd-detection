This project focuses on developing an efficient crowd detection and tracking system using OpenCV, employing techniques like background subtraction (MOG2) and morphological filtering to detect, track, and count individuals in real-time. It is designed to monitor crowd dynamics as people cross predefined entry and exit lines, facilitating accurate data collection. The system's lightweight implementation ensures suitability for resource-constrained environments while maintaining accuracy, offering a practical solution for effective crowd management without the complexity or high computational demands of deep learning models.
